# My-First-3DS-Homebrew
I'm not really working on a specific homebrew. I more just want help with learning how to do homebrews. I want help learning how to write homebrews for TubeHax in C++. Thats all I want to say for now. I will probably edit this when I think I'm ready to make my own 3DS homebrew.
